# Reverse-Shell-Client
The reverse shell client is a Python based alternative for a netcat reverse shell listener (`nc -lvp <port>`).

The default reverse shell client (`rsh-client.py`) ships with lots of features such as uploading, downloading, executing and editing files on the (unix based) remote host you managed to get a shell on.

This is the server version of a reverse shell, this should be ran on the attackers side.
Note: `To forward your reverse shell to WAN, you can use tools like ngrok and tunnelin.`

Use this for educational purposes and only hack people with explicit permission! Take care.
